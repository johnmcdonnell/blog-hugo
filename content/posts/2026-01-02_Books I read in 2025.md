- _The Secrets of Consulting_ by Gerald Weinberg.
- _Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets_ by Svetlana Alexievich.
- _A Fistful of Shells: West Africa from the Rise of the Slave Trade to the Age of Revolution_ by Toby Green.
- _The Way of Kings_ by Brandon Sanderson. Stormlight Archive 1. Recommended by Emmett Shear as an example of nobility.
- _Words of Radiance_ by Brandon Sanderson. Stormlight Archive 2.
- * _The Origins of Efficiency_ by Brian Potter.
- _Original Love: The Four Inns on the Path of Awakening_ by Henry Shukman. I also attended a retreat with the author at Mount Madonna.
- * _Stubborn Attachments_ by Tyler Cowen. It takes bravery to just confess your assumptions and moral frameworks in this manner. One of the most important implications: What is your discount factor? If it's low you should care about climate change but also you should want to reduce taxes on the rich. If it's high, vice versa. But how many of us are consistent in our moral discount factors?

I think the best book here is Stubborn Attachments, which is also quite short. You probably won't agree with his specific framework but it really highlights a lot of important cruxes that everyone should be dealing with regardless of where they fall.

Frankly a disappointing year in my book choices. Hopefully I am starting the new year off on a better foot with Tokarczuk's _Books of Jacob_.

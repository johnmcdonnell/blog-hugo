# Ross Douthat on Religion

Disclaimer: I am Catholic. But a very weird one, as you will see.

Ross Douthat recently did a Conversation with Tyler ([here](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/ross-douthat-3/)) where he tries to convince Tyler to take religion more seriously.
Vainly, I felt like I could maybe do a better job than Ross at making the case.

## First of all, framing: What is religion?
Religion is the OS of your mind. Know what makes eg Catholicism religious more than believing simulation theory is how much it affects your behavior & subjective experience.
Everyone has a religion in this sense, even if they don't call it that. If you're a firm atheist, that actually behaves like a religion in a lot of ways.
See for example, Joe Carlsmith on the implications of Yudkowsky's "even deeper" atheism [here](https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/01/11/an-even-deeper-atheism).

One thing that's tricky here is that the most important thing about religion is that the OS works well in creating good outcomes, but it also often 
comes with a lot of particular claims about the world that feel like they should determine selection. Since those claims were the main thing Ross and Tyler talked about I'll stick to that side of things,
but I should probably write a post about the outcomes.

# Material reductionism is the modern religion

Material reductionism is the dominant religion of elite human capital in 2025. It is dominant because it has been very successful
at empowering science, which in turn enables a lot of technology and so-called "data-driven" decision making and professional practices.
It is excellent at answering many types of questions about the phsyical world that we all have shared access to.
It is the thing that makes Tyler feel that he is grounded and Douthat is ungrounded and slightly nutty.

## The three unanswered questions
Unfortunately, there are three questions that material reductionism is not good at answering:

* Why is there something instead of nothing?
* Why is there phenomenological experience?
* What is moral?

Unfortunately all three of these questions are important, they are not explained by material reductionism now, and they will not be explaned by it in the future.
That doesn't make any particular religion correct, but it should make it clear that the reductionist view doesn't help when we need it most.

# Phenomenology is the big problem

Pain matters because it causes phenomenological experience of suffering. Causing pain is morally bad only because of that.
If it didn't cause suffering it would be no big deal.
This means that phenomenology is central to morality.
The phenomenological world is the world that matters morally, and the physical world does not matter, or matters only instrumentally.

This should induce a figure-ground flip in our world view: Instead of the material world being "primary" and phenomenology is some epiphenomenon, phenomonology is the real thing that matters, and the 
material world is more of a theoretical concept used to explain patterns in what we experience phenomenologically.
It's the material world that's not "really" real, or it's real like the Matrix is real.

Again, I can't claim that some particular religion has the correct explanation here, but materialism offers only a superficial perspective on the most important thing so we should not be satisfied with it.

# Tyler's skepticism

I went and compiled Tyler's concerns about religion based on the conversation.

1. Why not think there are multiple layers of God? What we think of as God is just part of the chain. In Bayesian terms, if a god created us, well, some being could have created that god. Why aren’t you led to that as a view with pretty high probability?
2. If you just showed up and said, ‘Tyler, I will save your soul. You should be a deist,’ we’d have a very different conversation. But when someone puts forward a very specific claim, I just don’t trust their specific intuitions. They seem so tied to society, conformist pressures, family, what they learned as a kid.
3. Does it worry you that when many people take psychedelics, they feel spirituality, religion, the presence of God, the supernatural? It’s obviously a natural cause.
4. It would be very odd to me. It’s like Descartes’s interaction problem, how one day is different from the next. Look, what does the day look like when the trilobite becomes the God-perceiving human?
5. People report seeing and hearing angels and demons, right? But there’s not an MP3 file or a photo where you would say, ‘Oh, here we go.’ That’s very odd to me.
6. If people say X, Y, and Z — there’re all sorts of religions neither you nor I would sign onto, and plenty of humans who will assert, insist that there’s direct evidence for that particular religion.  The story of Joseph Smith, the plates from LDS, would be one example, but there’re plenty of religions that don’t even exist anymore, where there’re very particular stories that people have attested to. We really do dismiss them in the numbers of the tens of millions or maybe even billions.
7. Doesn’t it worry you that for all of these instances of the supernatural, there’s never enough evidence accumulated to convince actual scientists?
8. think I’m closer to the Colin McGinn view that we’re just not smart enough to understand consciousness. It’s a puzzle. It should make us more agnostic about many things, but it’s not an excuse to go multiply all these other entities.


Here I give my gut reaction, 

1. Multiple layers of god is up for grabs! But it's worth thinking about religious epistemics, so I'll write about that below.
2. Religious epistemics is hard but not impossible, just as it's not a waste of time to think about ethics.
3. Honestly I thnk the most important aspect of psychedelics is that they help people see that phenomenology is what's real.
4. Phenomenological experience is weird and we don't understand it, that doesn't mean there's not a truth to the matter. It seems like dogs have phenomenological experience and rocks don't. Trilobite, I don't know! But there is a truth of the matter.
5. Angels and demons and levitation definitely occur in the phenomenological world, I'm skeptical if they do in the the material world. I don't think the material world is super important!
6. Seems to be the same concern as #2.
7. I'm not as sold as Douthat on supernatural events in the material world, but again, scientists are applying material reductionism which can't address the most important questions.
8. I think this is where Tyler is deeply wrong in his perspective. Phenomenology isn't a "puzzle" it is the only thing that matters.


# Epistemics: How we can know stuff about religion.

I'm unusual in that I don't consider any of the religions "correct."
If there is a God, God is a very strange thing that is far from our human ability to understand.
So if we presume that the Christian idea of the trinity is "correct", we have to admit that we as humans don't actually understand it, and so our conception will never be "correct."
Rather, we can have an understanding that is "better" than it otherwise would be.

Flavors of epistemics

1. Converging evidence



I think of "God" as a frame for answering unanswered question #1: Why is there something instead of nothing?
If you think there's no God, you have to think some other weird thing like "stuff just exists on its own."
I might say, okay well there's some ordering principle by which stuff exists on its own.
So let's name that ordering principle "God," without presuming any particular characteristics about it.
Now we can ask questions about what this God thing is.

For one thing, this "God" thing shows a bizarre level of favoritism towards life in general and humans in particular.
The arbitrary physical constants are very specifically tuned to the values necessary to support life.
And on Earth billions of years of evolution led to a situation where human beings rule the planet,
with no natural predators other than [one specific Nile crocodile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_(crocodile)).
So God likes us in some way. Theories of God that say he hates life in general or humans in particular can be safely excluded,
although we can't rule out that we are a stepping stone to something else He likes even more.

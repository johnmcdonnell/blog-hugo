# Why be Religious?

Epistemic status: Divine Revelation
Disclaimer: I am Catholic.

Ross Douthat recently did a Conversation with Tyler
([here](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/ross-douthat-3/)) where he
tries to convince Tyler to take religion more seriously.
Vainly, I felt like I could maybe do a better job than Ross at making the case.

## First of all, framing: What is religion?
Religion is the OS of your mind. Know what makes eg Catholicism religious more
than believing simulation theory is how much it affects your behavior &
subjective experience. Everyone has a religion in this sense, even if they
don't call it that. If you're a firm atheist, why are you firm? 
See for example, Joe Carlsmith on the implications
of Yudkowsky's "even deeper" atheism
[here](https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/01/11/an-even-deeper-atheism).

A corrollary: You have an OS. You have a religion. You might just not call it that.

1. Certain values are important to you, and the world is a forum for action
   where meaning is manifested. You have a sense of morality and on some level
   you think stuff that happens matters.
2. You have a story you tell yourself about why things are the way they are.
   This story is a mythical view of reality making heavy use of imagery and
   symbolism. It contains entites that did not arise from your sensory input.
3. You have some sort of epistemology that you use to accept or reject new
   ideas that you are exposed to.

These don't have to be formal, internally consistent, or static from day to
day. These are just things that human minds do. Analytic approaches to e.g.
morality try to "do math" on values, and I'm not necessarily against that, but
most people don't do math they just have values and moral intuitions.

Your religion could make you happy or miserable, and cause you to make others
happy or miserable. It matters.

This is magnified by the social context: A large group of people with a
particular religious configuration could make themselves very happy or
miserable, and could make the world happy or miserable. Some religious
configurations might work much better or worse in the context of a group.


# Material reductionism is the modern religion of elites

Material reductionism is the dominant religion of elite human capital in 2025.
It is dominant because it has been very successful at empowering science, which
in turn enables a lot of technology and so-called "data-driven" decision making
and professional practices. It is excellent at answering many types of
questions about the phsyical world that we all have shared access to. It is the
thing that makes Tyler feel that he is grounded and Douthat is ungrounded and
slightly nutty.

# Material reductionism is not a complete religion
Unfortunately, material reductionism is not sufficient to be a human OS. In
particular there are three questions that material reductionism is not good at
answering:

* Why is there something instead of nothing?
* Why is there phenomenological experience?
* What is moral?

Unfortunately all three of these questions are important, they are not
explained by material reductionism now, and they will not be explaned by it in
the future. That doesn't make any particular religion correct, but the blank
will be filled in from somewhere.

People who say they are material reductionists tend to have strong moral
intuitions that do not follow from material reductionism.

# Phenomenology is the big problem

Phenomenology is central to morality.
Pain matters because it causes phenomenological experience of suffering.
Causing pain is morally bad only because of that.
The phenomenological world is the world that matters morally, and the physical
world does not matter, or matters only instrumentally.

Seeing this created a figure-ground flip in my world view: Instead of
the material world being "primary" with phenomenology is an epiphenomenon,
phenomonology is the real thing that matters, and the material world is more of
a theoretical concept used to explain patterns in what we experience
phenomenologically. It's the material world that's not "really" real, or it's
real like the Matrix is real.


# Tyler's skepticism

I went and compiled Tyler's concerns about religion based on the conversation.

1. Why not think there are multiple layers of God? What we think of as God is just part of the chain. In Bayesian terms, if a god created us, well, some being could have created that god. Why aren’t you led to that as a view with pretty high probability?
2. If you just showed up and said, ‘Tyler, I will save your soul. You should be a deist,’ we’d have a very different conversation. But when someone puts forward a very specific claim, I just don’t trust their specific intuitions. They seem so tied to society, conformist pressures, family, what they learned as a kid.
3. Does it worry you that when many people take psychedelics, they feel spirituality, religion, the presence of God, the supernatural? It’s obviously a natural cause.
4. It would be very odd to me. It’s like Descartes’s interaction problem, how one day is different from the next. Look, what does the day look like when the trilobite becomes the God-perceiving human?
5. People report seeing and hearing angels and demons, right? But there’s not an MP3 file or a photo where you would say, ‘Oh, here we go.’ That’s very odd to me.
6. If people say X, Y, and Z — there’re all sorts of religions neither you nor I would sign onto, and plenty of humans who will assert, insist that there’s direct evidence for that particular religion.  The story of Joseph Smith, the plates from LDS, would be one example, but there’re plenty of religions that don’t even exist anymore, where there’re very particular stories that people have attested to. We really do dismiss them in the numbers of the tens of millions or maybe even billions.
7. Doesn’t it worry you that for all of these instances of the supernatural, there’s never enough evidence accumulated to convince actual scientists?
8. think I’m closer to the Colin McGinn view that we’re just not smart enough to understand consciousness. It’s a puzzle. It should make us more agnostic about many things, but it’s not an excuse to go multiply all these other entities.


Here I give my gut reaction, 

1. Multiple layers of god is up for grabs! But it's worth thinking about religious epistemics, so I'll write about that below.
2. Religious epistemics is hard but not impossible, just as it's not a waste of time to think about ethics.
3. Honestly I thnk the most important aspect of psychedelics is that they help people see that phenomenology is what's real.
4. Phenomenological experience is weird and we don't understand it, that doesn't mean there's not a truth to the matter. It seems like dogs have phenomenological experience and rocks don't. Trilobite, I don't know! But there is a truth of the matter.
5. Angels and demons and levitation definitely occur in the phenomenological world, I'm skeptical if they do in the the material world. I don't think the material world is super important!
6. Seems to be the same concern as #2.
7. I'm not as sold as Douthat on supernatural events in the material world, but again, scientists are applying material reductionism which can't address the most important questions.
8. I think this is where Tyler is deeply wrong in his perspective. Phenomenology isn't a "puzzle" it is the only thing that matters.


# Epistemics: How we can know stuff about religion.

I'm unusual in that I don't consider any of the religions "correct."
If there is a God, God is a very strange thing that is far from our human ability to understand.
So if we presume that the Christian idea of the trinity is "correct", we have to admit that we as humans don't actually understand it, and so our conception will never be "correct."
Rather, we can have an understanding that is better than it otherwise would be.

Flavors of epistemics

1. Converging evidence



I think of "God" as a frame for answering unanswered question #1: Why is there something instead of nothing?
If you think there's no God, you have to think some other weird thing like "stuff just exists on its own."
I might say, okay well there's some ordering principle by which stuff exists on its own.
So let's name that ordering principle "God," without presuming any particular characteristics about it.
Now we can ask questions about what this God thing is.

For one thing, this "God" thing shows a bizarre level of favoritism towards life in general and humans in particular.
The arbitrary physical constants are very specifically tuned to the values necessary to support life.
And on Earth billions of years of evolution led to a situation where human beings rule the planet,
with no natural predators other than [one specific Nile crocodile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_(crocodile)).
So God likes us in some way. Theories of God that say he hates life in general or humans in particular can be safely excluded,
although we can't rule out that we are a stepping stone to something else He likes even more.

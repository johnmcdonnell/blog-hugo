My main theme for 2023 was religion, and Buddhism in particular, so I've moved
those into their own section.

## Fiction
* _Circe_ by Madeline Miller [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe)
* _Ficciones_ by Jorge Luis Borges [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/426504.Ficciones)
* _Cold Nights of Childhood_ by Tezer Özlü [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61157636-cold-nights-of-childhood)
* _The Death of Ivan Ilych_ by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Pevear and Volokhonsky [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18386.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilych)
* _Cryptonomicon_ by Neal Stephenson [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon) [my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2115211297)
* _The Oedipus Trilogy_ by Sophocles, new translation by Bryan Doerries [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57499882-oedipus-trilogy)
* _God's' Dog: Monster_ a graphic novel by Jonathan Pageau and Matthieu Pageau [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90995601-god-s-dog)
* _There Is No Antimemetics Division_ by qntm [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54870256-there-is-no-antimemetics-division)

In our ADHD TikTok world short fiction is a godsend. I read _Cold Nights of
Childhood_ almost in one sitting and proclaimed to myself that all books should
be either 100 pages or 1000 pages with nothing in-between. Reaching for
short story after, I inhaled Borges' _Ficciones_. Now I've started on Michael R
Katz' [promising new translation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200196904-the-brothers-karamazov)
of _Brothers Karamazov_ and we'll see if I really have the stamina to mix the
sweet morsels with truly heavy fare.

I didn't directly seek to read religious fiction but the theme has enriched
my reading. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky are obviously evangelists. But what is the
theology of Miller's Circe? Why is the source of Özlü's heroine's irrepressible
zest for life?

**My Favorite**: Qntm's _There is no Antimimetics Division_. Pulpy yet
geniuinely novel. And we live in a time of intense conflict in both the mimetic
and antimimetic spheres. Likely the most underrated of the works here.

## Nonfiction
* _The Sassoons: The Great Global Merchants and the Making of an Empire_ by Joseph Sassoon [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59811807-the-sassoons)
* _The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages 400-1000_ by Chris Wickham [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6297739-the-inheritance-of-rome)
* _Super-Infinite: The Transformations of John Donne_ by Katherine Rundell [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59851731-super-infinite) [my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6047198802)
* _How to Be a Founder: How Entrepreneurs Can Identify, Fund and Launch Their Best Ideas_ by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58532147-how-to-be-a-founder)
* _Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher_ by Richard Feynman [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5553.Six_Easy_Pieces)
* _Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential_ by Tiago Forte [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain)

How did the catholic church get so successful? People take it for granted that
the church was a middle ages thing when in fact operating a vast NGO in a time
of anarchy is one of the strangest things that ever happened. Why did anyone
outside of Italy listen to the popes? Wickham doesn't focus on this question
but can't help answering it (in as few words as possible: their alliance with
the Carolingians in the 8th century). This is important as context for Henrich's
_WEIRDest People in the World_, because this is ultimately how Europe got so
_WEIRD_. What happens when a penniless yet devout Baghdadi jew strikes it rich
in Mumbai? What made it possible? What motivates his descendants? Did anybody
every stop to conisder it may have been wrong to be pushing opium on China?

_The Sassoons_ and _Super-Infinite_ were also excellent simply at providing
slices of life that remind one how huge the world is.

**My Favorite**: Rundell's _Super-Infinite_. Those were different times
indeed and yet Rundell can paint them in vivid detail. Goodreads review

## Religion

* _Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World_ by Tara Isabella Burton [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51720367-strange-rites)
* _Breathing Under Water: Spirituality and the Twelve Steps_ by Richard Rohr, OFM [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/563135.Breathing_Underwater)
* _The Life of St. Benedict_ by Gregory the Great, with translation and commentary by Terrence G. Kardong, OSB [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6650710-the-life-of-st-benedict-by-gregory-the-great)
* _The Rule of Saint Benedict_ by Benedict of Nursia [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82406.The_Rule_of_Saint_Benedict)
* _The Problem of God: Yesterday and Today_ by John Courtney Murray, SJ [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1224841.The_Problem_of_God)
* _The Language of Creation: Cosmic Symbolism in Genesis_ by Matthieu Pageau [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192316-the-language-of-creation)
* _Tattoos on the Heart: The Power of Boundless Compassion_ by Gregory Boyle, SJ [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090193-tattoos-on-the-heart)
* _The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Life_ by James Martin, SJ [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6829199-the-jesuit-guide-to-almost-everything)

Tyler Cowen has predicted that [the most important thinkers of the future will
be religious ones](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/02/why-will-the-important-thinkers-of-the-future-be-religious-ones.html).
But what does that look like? Each book here proposes a set of values and
spiritual epistemics. Although I leaned heavily on Catholicism due to my
background, the catholic perspectives presented here were extremely diverse.

**My Favorite**: _Tattoos on the Heart_ demonstrates a value system that is
clearly superior to mainstream culture's. If we imagine that the right wants to
build a big wall around the center to protect from the periphery and the left
wants to burn the center to the ground, Boyle wants to bring the periphery into
the center to make a greater whole. And he is ready to devote his life to it
with no hope of material reward. Boyle made me deeply question my own life
choices and motivations.

## Buddhism
* _The Science of Enlightenment: Teachings and Meditations for Awakening Through Self-Investigation_ by Shinzen Young [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1663855.The_Science_of_Enlightenment)
* _The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science_ by Culadasa [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25942786-the-mind-illuminated)
* _Dependent Origination and Emptiness_ by Leigh Brasington [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59487139-dependent-origination-and-emptiness)
* _Spaciousness: The Radical Dzogchen of the Vajra-Heart_ by Longchenpa, translated by Keith Dowman [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18365925-spaciousness)
* _Seeing that Frees_ by Rob Burbea [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25172403-seeing-that-frees)

Can we end suffering for ourselves and for all sentient beings? Buddhism says
yes, and crucially, we can do it in a life-affirming way. Important if true!

In addition to these books I've been spending a lot of time learning both from
Kati Devaney and Michael Taft at the 
[Berkeley Alembic](https://berkeleyalembic.org/), and from Toby Sola via his
digital sangha [Brightmind](https://www.brightmind.com/). Toby and Michael were
both students of Shinzen Young. Interestingly they've both published there own
reading lists! Toby' is [here](https://www.brightmind.com/reading) and
Michael's is [here](https://deconstructingyourself.com/best-meditation-books-2020.html)

**My Favorite** Young's _The Science of Enlightenment_ paints a compelling
picture of the commonalities among the world's mystical traditions, arguing
that there's a kind of "spiritual physics" that all traditions provide windows
into.

## Memoir
* _Pieces of the Action_ by Vannevar Bush [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290284-pieces-of-the-action)
* _The Pathless Path: Imagining a New Story for Work and Life_ by Paul Millerd [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60151185-the-pathless-path)
* _Greenlights_ by Matthew McConaughey [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52838315-greenlights)
* _Free Spirited: How My Daughter Healed Me From the Afterlife_ by Suzanne Falter (my neighbor) [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69703107-free-spirited)

**My Favorite** Greenlights was great entertainment and demonstrate how far you
can get with a great attitude. I listened to McConaughey narrate his own
audiobook which adds an additional layer of fun.

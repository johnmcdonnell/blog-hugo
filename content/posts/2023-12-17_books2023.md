# Books I read in 2023

This year I was able to spend time with a lot of books. I spent a lot more time
than usual thinking about religion this year and Buddhism in particular. Since
I didn't do a roundup last year I've 

## Fiction
* _Circe_ by Madeline Miller [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe)
* _Ficciones_ by Jorge Luis Borges [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/426504.Ficciones)
* _Cold Nights of Childhood_ by Tezer Özlü [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61157636-cold-nights-of-childhood)
* _The Death of Ivan Ilych_ by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Pevear and Volokhonsky [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18386.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilych)
* _Cryptonomicon_ by Neal Stephenson [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.Cryptonomicon)
* _The Oedipus Trilogy_ by Sophocles, new translation by Bryan Doerries [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57499882-oedipus-trilogy)
* _God's' Dog: Monster_ a graphic novel by Jonathan Pageau and Matthieu Pageau [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90995601-god-s-dog)
* _There Is No Antimemetics Division_ by qntm [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54870256-there-is-no-antimemetics-division)

In our ADHD world short fiction is a godsend. I read _Cold Nights of Childhood_
almost in one sitting and proclaimed to myself that all books should be either
100 pages or 1000 pages with no need for in-between. Reaching for short story
after, I inhaled Borges _Ficciones_. Now I've started on Michael R Katz'
[promising new translation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200196904-the-brothers-karamazov)
of _Brothers Karamazov_ and we'll see if I really have the stamina to mix the
sweet morsels with truly heavy fare.

**My Favorite**: Qntm's _There is no Antimimetics Division_. Pulpy yet
geniuinely novel. And we live in a time of intense conflict in both the mimetic
and antimimetic spheres. Probably the most underrated of the works here.

## Nonfiction
* _The Sassoons: The Great Global Merchants and the Making of an Empire_ by Joseph Sassoon [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59811807-the-sassoons)
* _The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages 400-1000_ by Chris Wickham [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6297739-the-inheritance-of-rome)
* _Super-Infinite: The Transformations of John Donne_ by Katherine Rundell [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59851731-super-infinite)
* _How to Be a Founder: How Entrepreneurs Can Identify, Fund and Launch Their Best Ideas_ by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58532147-how-to-be-a-founder)
* _Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher_ by Richard Feynman [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5553.Six_Easy_Pieces)
* _Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential_ by Tiago Forte [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain)

My big theme this year was religion so it gets its own section. One question I
kept asking myself reading _The Inheritance of Rome_: How did the catholic
church get so successful? And the answer seems to be the alliance with the
Carolingians they forged in the 8th century. Important as context for Henrich's
_WEIRDest People in the World_, because this is ultimately how Europe got so
_WEIRD_.

_The Sassoons_ and _Super-Infinite_ were also excellent simply at providing
slices of life that remind one how huge the world is.

**My Favorite**: Rundell's _Super-Infinite_. Those were different times
indeed and yet Rundell can paint them in vivid detail. Goodreads review

## Religion

* _Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World_ by Tara Isabella Burton [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51720367-strange-rites)
* _Breathing Under Water: Spirituality and the Twelve Steps_ by Richard Rohr, OFM [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/563135.Breathing_Underwater)
* _The Life of St. Benedict_ by Gregory the Great, with translation and commentary by Terrence G. Kardong OSB [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6650710-the-life-of-st-benedict-by-gregory-the-great)
* _The Rule of Saint Benedict_ by Benedict of Nursia [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82406.The_Rule_of_Saint_Benedict)
* _The Problem of God: Yesterday and Today_ by John Courtney Murray, SJ [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1224841.The_Problem_of_God)
* _The Language of Creation: Cosmic Symbolism in Genesis_ by Matthieu Pageau [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192316-the-language-of-creation)
* _Tattoos on the Heart: The Power of Boundless Compassion_ by Gregory Boyle, SJ [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090193-tattoos-on-the-heart)
* _The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Life_ by James Martin, SJ [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6829199-the-jesuit-guide-to-almost-everything)

Tyler Cowen has predicted that [the most important thinkers of the future will
be religious
ones](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/02/why-will-the-important-thinkers-of-the-future-be-religious-ones.html).
So I have read through some contenders, with special attention to Buddhism
which is broken out into its own section. Each book here proposes a set of
values and spiritual epistemics. Although I leaned heavily on Catholicism due
to my background, the catholic perspectives presented here were extremely
diverse.

**My Favorite**: _Tattoos on the Heart_ clearly demonstrates a value system
that is superior to mainstream culture's. People sent him bomb threats for the
work he did helping gang kids integrate with their community. If we imagine
that the right wants to build a big wall around the center to protect from the
periphery and the left wants to burn the center to the ground, Boyle wants to
bring the periphery into the center to make a greater whole. Boyle made me
deeply question my own life choices and motivations.

## Buddhism
* _The Science of Enlightenment: Teachings and Meditations for Awakening Through Self-Investigation_ by Shinzen Young [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1663855.The_Science_of_Enlightenment)
* _The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science_ by Culadasa [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25942786-the-mind-illuminated)
* _Dependent Origination and Emptiness_ by Leigh Brasington [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59487139-dependent-origination-and-emptiness)
* _Spaciousness: The Radical Dzogchen of the Vajra-Heart_ by Longchenpa, translated by Keith Dowman [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18365925-spaciousness)
* _Seeing that Frees_ by Rob Burbea [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25172403-seeing-that-frees)

Buddhism can be seen as a hypothesis that we can end suffering in a way that is
life-affirming through spiritual work. Important if true!

**My Favorite** Young's _The Science of Enlightenment_ helped me see the
commonalities among the world's mystical traditions, making a strong argument
that there's a kind of "spiritual physics" that is a universal human trait.

## Memoir
* _Pieces of the Action_ by Vannevar Bush [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290284-pieces-of-the-action)
* _The Pathless Path: Imagining a New Story for Work and Life_ by Paul Millerd [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60151185-the-pathless-path)
* _Greenlights_ by Matthew McConaughey [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52838315-greenlights)
* _Free Spirited: How My Daughter Healed Me From the Afterlife_ by Suzanne Falter (my neighbor) [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69703107-free-spirited)

**My Favorite** Greenlights was great entertainment and demonstrate how far you
can get with a great attitude. I listened to McConaughey narrate his own
audiobook which adds an additional layer of fun.

# ChatGPT on Bach's Mass in B Minor

ChatGPT is surprisingly useful or learning about and appreciating art. For the
longest time I didn't understand the fuss about Bach's Mass in B Minor. It felt
overlong and taking it literally as a Mass, I thought it was zany that it took
about twenty minutes to say "Kyrie Eleison, Christe Eleison, Kyrie Eleison".
But now I've cracked it and I can't stop listening to it.

One really useful way ChatGPT helped me was by explaining the musical ideas in
each movement. Bach is contrasting different styles and moods to construct a
prayer that touches on many aspects of spirituality. I'm reproducing the full
deep dive here.

## Kyrie

### kyrie eleison
this is a full-on choral fugue, but soaked in grief. it’s written in _stile
antico_, the “old style,” nodding to renaissance polyphony (think palestrina)
but with bach’s brutal precision and depth. voices layer in slowly, each
entering like someone stepping into a funeral procession. the counterpoint is
tight, but the harmony is dark, dissonances rubbed raw. it’s less supplication
than lamentation.

### christe eleison
suddenly we’re in a bright galant duet for two sopranos, way more modern in
style, almost italianate. it’s as if he’s saying: penitence has many
masks—tears, grace, longing, light.

### kyrie eleison
the second _kyrie_ slams you back into minor-key choral counterpoint, tighter and
more urgent than the first. less mournful, more pleading.

it’s like he’s setting up a triptych of theological mood swings. each one a
different mode of crying out. none of them quite resolving.

## Gloria
the gloria in the mass in b minor is like bach throwing the whole arsenal at
the heavens. it’s exuberant, kaleidoscopic, stylistically omnivorous. here’s a
quick character sketch of each movement:

### gloria in excelsis deo
full choral + trumpet explosion. d major. this is joy as fireworks.
rhythmically insistent, harmonically bold. it’s bach saying “look up.”

### et in terra pax
abrupt mood shift—slower, more solemn. fugal textures, rich suspensions. this
is peace as something hard-won, not soft. almost feels like a choral sigh after
the opening blast.

### laudamus te
soprano solo with violin—graceful, italianate, dance-adjacent. the praise here
is personal, elegant, almost flirtatious. a galant interlude.

### gratias agimus tibi
chorus again, and a fugue. more restrained than the opening—formal gratitude,
not ecstatic. it’s a revision of a cantata chorus, bc of course it is.

### domine deus
duet for tenor and soprano with flute. warm, lyrical. one of the most pastoral
sections—god as light and beauty. feels like a miniature opera duet in a
clearing.

### qui tollis peccata mundi
chorus with plaintive oboe. minor key, slow, weighty. the lamb of god taking
away sin feels crushing, like divine empathy under pressure.

### qui sedes ad dexteram patris
alto aria with oboe d’amore. lilting, almost dance-like. a little odd, tonally
ambiguous—heavenly throne room as courtly salon?

### quoniam tu solus sanctus
bass aria with… horn and two bassoons? yeah. it’s weird, regal, and beastly.
kind of an echo of the quoniam in the credo. like bach built a menagerie for
the trinity.

### cum sancto spiritu
closing choral fugue, full-on baroque banger. relentless, brilliant,
engineered. like the heavens turned into clockwork and started to sing. feels
earned after the journey.

## Credo

the credo is the theological meat of the mass and bach sets it like a gothic
vault: dense, structural, symbolic. this isn’t belief as feeling—it’s belief as
architecture. eleven movements, each a rhetorical brick.

### credo in unum deum
a choral creed-fugue—strict, stile antico, evoking ancient authority.
monotone-ish intonation on “credo” over imitative counterpoint. feels eternal,
pre-baroque, etched in stone.

### patrem omnipotentem
switches to stile moderno—bright, orchestral, flowing lines. like the doctrine
of the Father gets a fresher, more narrative setting. classic contrast play.

### et in unum dominum
duet for soprano and alto. sweet and balanced—an intimate assertion of the
Son’s divinity. like theology sung as a madrigal.

### et incarnatus est
massive mood shift. slow, hushed, suspended harmonies. incarnation becomes
mystery. the music almost stops breathing. bach’s handling here is reverent to
the edge of fear.

### crucifixus
passacaglia over a descending bass line = death spiral. choral writing is
static, weary, beautiful in the way rot can be. baroque despair. one of the
most devastating movements he ever wrote.

### et resurrexit
whiplash—suddenly we’re in dazzling d major, trumpets screaming. resurrection =
ecstasy. fugue built from leaping motifs, as if Christ vaults out of the tomb.

### et in spiritum sanctum
bass aria with two oboes d’amore—gentle, lyrical, almost pastoral. holy spirit
as warm breath, not fire. it’s serene. oddly human-scale for the third person
of the trinity.

### confiteor unum baptisma
BACK to stile antico. this is a double fugue. deeply austere. tightest
counterpoint in the mass. if “i confess one baptism” were etched into granite,
it would sound like this.

### et expecto resurrectionem
this is where it _snaps_. the fugue collapses into suspended harmony—like the
world holding its breath—and then erupts into joy. resurrection is no longer
abstract, it’s here. total musical catharsis.

...the credo is structured like a theological narrative: from eternal god to
the human christ to cosmic victory. bach uses style-switching (old/new,
fugue/aria, minor/major) as his rhetorical toolkit.

each movement isn’t just a belief—it’s an experience of that belief. the whole
credo feels like an act of construction: belief laid brick by counterpointed
brick, until it forms a temple large enough to sing in.

## Sanctus

### sanctus
starts in 3/8, in a slow, stately dance—almost sarabande-like. but this isn’t
human dance—it’s the cosmos in procession. the rhythm pulses like celestial
breath.

he opens with massive block chords (“sanctus, sanctus, sanctus”)—not
contrapuntal but architectural, as if each voice is a stone laid in the temple.
harmonic rhythm is glacial. every shift feels like tectonic plates moving.

then the fugue: “dominvs devs sabaoth.” now it takes flight. swirling melismas,
imitation, ecstatic layering. the mood turns from reverent to blazing. this
isn’t just praise, it’s overwhelming.

you can hear the seraphim circling, like in isaiah’s vision—“holy holy holy”
not whispered but thundered by entities made of fire.

### pleni sunt caeli et terra gloria eius
modulation to e minor—darker, more earthy. the text says “heaven and earth are
full of his glory” and bach responds by grounding it. rhythm picks up.
counterpoint becomes thicker, more imitative. the architecture gets messy—in a
good way. fullness = complexity.

### hosanna in excelsis
back to d major and trumpet ecstasy. it’s the same music he’ll use later after
the benedictus—clearly linked. double choir, fast compound meter, relentless
rhythmic drive. this is exaltation as centrifuge. it spins and spins and
refuses to resolve.



## Benedictus
ah, the _benedictus_—that’s one of the strangest, most delicate moments in the
whole mass.

where so much of the _mass in b minor_ is cosmic, overwhelming, vertical, the
_benedictus_ is intimate, almost private. it’s scored for just tenor, flute, and
continuo. no chorus. no grandeur. it feels like stepping out of a cathedral
into a quiet grove.

the melody is sinuous, floating, almost improvisatory. the flute weaves around
the tenor like breath around prayer. harmonically it’s gentle but
unsettled—like hope tempered by sorrow.

and that text—“blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord”—usually gets
triumphant settings. bach makes it tender, maybe even fragile. like the arrival
isn’t a parade, but a whispered entrance.

it’s a moment of human-scale devotion in a work that otherwise feels built for
angels. and then—boom—the hosanna returns in full choral glory, shattering the
hush. you barely get to sit with the benedictus before being swept away again.
it’s the eye of the storm.


## Agnus Dei

### agnus dei
the _agnus dei_ is a plea for mercy and peace, set in g minor. bach adapted
this movement from an earlier aria, “ach, bleibe doch,” from his _ascension
oratorio_, which itself was derived from the lost wedding cantata _auf, süß
entzückende gewalt_.  the aria features a solo alto voice intertwined with an
obbligato violin line, creating a texture of intimate supplication.


### dona nobis pacem
the _dona nobis pacem_ isn’t new music—it’s a reprise of the _gratias agimus
tibi_ fugue from the gloria. but bach recontextualizes it, and that changes
everything.

in the gloria, the music says “thank you”; here, it begs for peace. same notes,
different soul. this is baroque semiotics at full power—meaning arises not just
from melody but from **placement**.

musically, it’s in d major, bright and triumphant—but the text is dona nobis
pacem, and that plea feels deeper than the surface. it’s not soft or
meditative—it’s monumental. this is peace as an act of will, not a gentle
afterthought. like bach is insisting on peace the way a general might demand
surrender.

also: ending the mass on a fugue—not on an aria, not on a chorus of
resolution—is weird and brilliant. there’s no quiet fade, no “amen.” instead, a
return to formal structure, to recursive logic, to music-as-machine-of-hope.

so what should you note?
* it’s a quotation masquerading as a prayer
* it’s circular—bringing the mass full-circle in theme and form
* it’s peace not as balm but as burden, shouted into the void

this isn’t peace you fall into. it’s peace you build. fugally. together.


## Recordings

I also asked ChatGPT for recommendations on recordings, mentioning that the one
I've had on repeat is Pichon's latest recording (which I strongly recommend
btw). It googled and responded:

pichon’s new mass in b minor is a lush, emotionally charged take—more romantic
than purist. his tempos swing wide: the second kyrie is glacial, the gloria
bursts forward, and the crucifixus hits like a hammer. some critics love the
drama; others find it overwrought and question the balance between voices and
instruments.  ￼ ￼

for contrast, check out:
* **gardiner (1985)**: crisp, agile, with a lean period-instrument sound. his cum sancto spiritu is a masterclass in controlled exuberance.
* **herreweghe (1998)**: lyrical and restrained. the et incarnatus est here is all hush and inward glow—less theater, more prayer.
* **harnoncourt (1968)**: raw, edgy, and historically bold. it’s not pretty, but it’s alive. the quoniam sounds like a baroque fever dream. ￼
* **richter (1961)**: massive, reverent, unapologetically romantic. not HIP, but if you want your dona nobis pacem to feel like the end of the world, this is it. ￼
